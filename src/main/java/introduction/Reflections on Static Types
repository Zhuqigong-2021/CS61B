Reflections on Static Typing

The Good:
  Catches certain types of errors, making it easier on the programmer to debug their code.
  Type errors can (almost) never occur on the end user's computer.
  Makes it easier to read and reason about code.
  Code can run more efficiently,eg.no need to do expensive runtime type checks

The Bad:
  Code is more verbose.
  Code is less general.There is a way around this in Java(generics)
